# Garden Office Hours

Welcome to our repo for the Garden Community Office Hours!

## What is Community Office Hours?

We set aside half an hour every Friday to invite anyone in the Garden Community (Core users, customers, or even if you're just intrigued by us) to come and hang out with us and get to know you all.

## What do we discuss?

Anything and everything Garden! We recently been discussing DevOps and Kubernetes related topics, and we host a four-weekly Public Issue Triage session.

We also want to get closer to the issues the Community itself is facing. So we have a place in this repo to allow you to submit your own topic ‚Üê LINK.
